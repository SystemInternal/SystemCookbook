cell signaling pathways that control cell growth and division. It is frequently mutated in various cancers, which can influence patient outcomes and treatment responses. For instance, studies suggest that KRAS mutations are associated with mixed effects on overall survival across different types of cancer, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) [1][5]. In colorectal cancer, KRAS testing has been linked to prognosis, but the strength of this association varies [2]. Furthermore, specific mutations, like the KRAS G13D variant, have been identified in cases of metastatic colorectal tumors [4]. Overall, while there are established associations between KRAS mutations and cancer prognosis, the variability in findings indicates that the impact of these mutations can differ significantly among patients and cancer types.\n","    </div>\n","    <hr>\n","    "],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n","        <strong>Theme:</strong> Function of KRAS<br><br>\n","        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>\n","        KRAS plays a significant role in various cellular functions and processes within the body. It is involved in regulating transcription, which is the process by which genes are turned on to produce RNA, and subsequently proteins necessary for cell function. This regulation affects numerous pathways including those related to apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and response to drugs, among others [205]. KRAS is known to positively regulate the activation of several key signaling pathways including HNRNP, TGFB, NFkappaB, and ERK, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival [209]. Additionally, KRAS influences the expression of other proteins such as Cyclin D1, Ki-67, and Bcl2, which are associated with cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and apoptosis [245][250][276]. The interaction of KRAS with different molecules, such as GTP, is essential for its activity, as it binds GTP to drive cellular signaling cascades [57]. Furthermore, KRAS affects the levels of various cyclins and signaling molecules, thereby impacting the progression of the cell cycle and tumor development [111]. Overall, the functions of KRAS are central to the regulation of many processes that contribute to cancer progression and cellular homeostasis.\n","    </div>\n","    <hr>\n","    "],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n","        <strong>Theme:</strong> KRAS Mutations<br><br>\n","        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>\n","        KRAS mutations play a significant role in the prognosis and treatment of various cancers. In the context of metastatic colorectal cancer, KRAS mutations are generally associated with increases in progression-free survival; however, the overall strength of this effect can vary across studies [6]. Conversely, in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, KRAS mutations are associated with decreases in overall survival, indicating that the impact of these mutations can differ based on the type of cancer [7][15]. Moreover, KRAS mutations are linked to overall survival in advanced colorectal cancer patients, although the strength of this association is again mixed [19]. In addition to survival outcomes, KRAS mutations contribute to disease dissemination in colon cancer patients [21]. KRAS mutations are also correlated with increases in tumor grade and stage, suggesting that these mutations might indicate a more aggressive cancer phenotype [52][56]. Furthermore, the prevalence of KRAS mutations is noted to be higher among smokers, although the strength of this correlation is mixed [61]. Overall, KRAS mutations serve as a critical biomarker in cancer pathology, influencing not only the disease progression but also the potential therapeutic targets available for treatment.\n","    </div>\n","    <hr>\n","    "],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n","        <strong>Theme:</strong> Associated Cancers<br><br>\n","        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>\n","        The KRAS gene plays a significant role in various cancers, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. KRAS mutations, specifically the G12D mutation, are associated with an increased rate of metastatic tumors, highlighting their aggressive nature in cancer progression [257]. Additionally, KRAS is linked to pancreatic cancer diagnoses, where its mutation is notably common [307]. In colorectal cancer, Kirsten Ras mutations correlate with decreased disease-specific survival, indicating a poorer prognosis for affected individuals [615]. Furthermore, specific mutations, such as G12C, are associated with increased frequencies of metastasectomies and ablations, suggesting a more challenging disease course [488]. In NSCLC, KRAS mutations are associated with increased radioresistance, complicating treatment options for this patient population [873]. These associations underscore the importance of KRAS as a key player in the pathology of several cancer types, influencing both survival outcomes and treatment responses.\n","    </div>\n","    <hr>\n","    "],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n","        <strong>Theme:</strong> Pathway Interactions<br><br>\n","        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>\n","        KRAS is a crucial player in several signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival. One of its key interactions is with RAF, a protein that plays a significant role in the MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway, where KRAS binds to RAF to activate downstream signaling [86]. In addition to RAF, KRAS is also activated by various factors including MEK, ERK, and multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), indicating its pivotal role in cellular signaling networks [124]. Furthermore, KRAS interacts with a variety of other proteins such as BRAF, MYC, and TP53, illustrating its extensive network of interactions that influence cell behavior [159]. This network is essential for the regulation of processes like cell proliferation and survival, making KRAS a vital component of tumorigenesis pathways in various cancers [548].

Sotorasib is one of the key agents that specifically inhibits the KRAS-G12C mutation, showing promise for treating patients with this particular mutation [125][147]. Additionally, immunotherapy has been linked to decreased disease progression in patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer when treated with first-line immunotherapy [690]. Furthermore, computational biological modeling has indicated that overall survival rates improve for advanced KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing PD-(L)1 immunotherapy [674]. However, it is crucial to note that in patients with KRAS mutations who received immune checkpoint inhibitors, there was no significant change in the progression-free survival compared to those with KRAS wild-type [420].
